Little tool meant to format a SQL query to be more readable.

Install the folder on a web server with PHP installed and call index.php in a browser.

- FROM and WHERE start on a new line
- 'SELECT', 'FROM' and 'WHERE' keywords are uppercased

But :
- would probably not handle well keywords inside strings yet
